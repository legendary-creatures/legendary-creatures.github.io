They are most commonly found in the folklore of Hutsulshchyna.</p>\n<p>Data about chuhajster is contradictive. Reports about chuhajster are somewhat similar to the reports about a bigfoot or saskwatch from the other parts of the world.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Skills-habits-functions\">Skills, habits, functions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Prevents growth of the population of forest spirits-pests (by hunting them).</li>\n<li>According to one tale, can tear off his own leg and cut wood with it.</li>\n<li>Runs very fast, even when moving on one leg</li>\n<li>Can create hail: freezes a lake, grind the ice into pieces, lift them in the sky and forwards wherever he wants.</li>\n<li>Can control animals: a wolf and a fox brought him water; a bear attacked a human by his order.</li>\n<li>Невразливий: neither human nor animal can harm him</li>\n<li>According to some beliefs chuhajster has his own household or farm</li>\n<li>Smokes tobacco, can ask passers-by to share their tobacco.</li>\n<li>According to one of the versions, chuhajster appeared when a man was cursed by a wizard or the god.</li>\n<li>Helps people lost in woods.</li>\n<li>Greets people he meets, asks them not to be afraid.</li>\n<li>Likes to warm, chatter and smoke tabacco at the human camp fire in the forest.</li>\n<li>Is afraid of an axe.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Teaches craft. Translation of notes by Ukrainian entographer Stepan Pushyk:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When some craftsman had not succeeded in some work, then Chuhajster tought how to do it. Chuhajster had given people every talent!\n[Original] Коли якомусь майстрові не вдалася робота, то Чугайстер поучував, як треба зробити. Чугайстер усякий дар людям дав!</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"Feeding-and-hunting\">Feeding and hunting</h3>\n<p>Hunts forest spirits (mavkas, povitrulas, forest nymphs, forest witches, forest devils, etc) and eats them. Consumes them raw or fried: piles already killed creature onto a stick and fries on a fire.</p>\n<p>Chuhajster knows paths of forest spirits and waits in ambush, hiding in leaves. He catches his prey as soon as it passes by.</p>\n<p>He kills by tearing the victim into two parts: steps on one victim's leg and pulls the other one.</p>\n<p>According to some beliefs a strong wind follows chuhajster when he is after his prey. Chuhajster becomes angry if his victim tries to run and hinde. His loud voice sounds like a thunder or windstorm in the trees.</p>\n<p>While looking for a hiding place mavkas can run inside shepherd huts, and even ask people to hide them from their pursuer.\nTo get close to povitrulas chuhajster can turn into a wolf, since povitrulas are not fraid of wolves.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Sleep\">Sleep</h3>\n<p>Sleeps curled up in a dense thichet, in dry leaves and branches. Also can sleep, curled into a circle around the fire or a кострища left by people.</p>\n<h3 id=\"How-to-know-that-a-chuhajster-is-nearby\">How to know that a chuhajster is nearby</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>strong wind</li>\n<li>strong rain</li>\n<li>thunder</li>\n<li>hail</li>\n<li>unusual (unnormal?) movement of the Moon in the sky</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Classification\">Classification</h2>\n<h3 id=\"Etymology\">Etymology</h3>\n<p>The origin of the word «chuhajster» is not exactly known. Scientists suggest foreign origin.</p>\n<p>Ukrainian linguist Bronislaw Kobylanskii suggested that both the character and its name originated from the South-Western dialects of Ukrainian language when hermits from Moldavian and Bukovinian monsteries appeared in Carpathian forests in XVII—XVIII centuries.</p>\n<p>The word part «chuha-» can originate from the Proto-Slavic «čuga» («watch», «sentry»):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>«chuha» («чу́га») - a cossac guard tower or pole wrapped in straw that is set on fire to warn about the approaching enemies</li>\n<li>«chuha» («чу́га»), «chuhanja» («чуганя»), «hunja» («гуня») - traditional ethnic woolen otwear of Gutsuls</li>\n<li>«chuhylo» («чугило») - a hole made in stone by running water</li>\n<li>«chuha» («чу́га») - scarecrow (in the dialect spoken in Negostyna village)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Значення «-(a)jster» is not clear. Might be related to the dialect name for a stork «hajster» («гайстер»).</p>\n<p>The names like «grandfather», «forest man» are most likely related to the tabooing of the demon names.</p>\n<p>Some authors write the name Chuhaister from the capital letter considering it a personal name.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Anthropology\">Anthropology</h2>\n<h3 id=\"Relationships-with-humans\">Relationships with humans</h3>\n<p>Lumberjacks believed that during winter chuhajster can climb into a flue of a hut to warm up and sing in there.</p>\n<p>According to some beliefs chuhajster is safe and friendly to people and even symphatises them.\nOthers mention that he does not like and even despises people. Except the ones who spend a lot of time in the forests and know \"forest manners\".</p>\n<h2 id=\"Sources\">Sources</h2>\n<p>In Ukrainian:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Гнатюк Володимир.
